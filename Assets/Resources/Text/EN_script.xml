			<Script_Text>To understand how mRNA vaccines protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19, we need to know exactly how the virus infects our body.</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>When the virus that causes COVID-19 virus enters our body...</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>...it uses specialized spikes on its exterior to attach to our cells.</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>Once the virus attaches, it inserts its genetic code, called RNA, into a cell to seize control of the human cell.</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>The virus’s genetic material tells the human cell to stop its normal job and focus on making copies of itself instead.</Script_Text>

		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>6</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>This turns our healthy cells into virus factories that then release more viruses that can then infect other cells.</Script_Text>
		</script_object>
		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>7</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>Because our cells are busy making the virus instead of doing their jobs to keep us healthy, we get really sick.</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>Vaccination is a way to teach our immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 before it can make us sick.</Script_Text>
		</script_object>
		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>9</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>To do so, a vaccine trains our immune system to recognize the spikes on COVID-19 and to destroy the virus.</Script_Text>
		</script_object>
		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>10</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>In particular, the mRNA vaccine contains information so that our body can make the spikes itself.</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>They look like the spikes on the virus but they are not actually the virus.</Script_Text>

			<Script_Text>...and then practice identifying and fighting the spikes by making antibodies.</Script_Text>

		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>14</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>Antibodies are like a virus muzzle.</Script_Text>
		</script_object>
		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>15</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>They attach themselves to the virus.</Script_Text>
		</script_object>
		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>16</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>This blocks the spikes from helping the virus infect a cell, making the virus unsuccessful.</Script_Text>
		</script_object>
		<script_object>
			<Script_ID>17</Script_ID>
			<Script_Text>Thanks to the vaccine, our bodies have already been trained to make these antibodies. So, we are ready to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 the moment it gets into our body, and we have a better chance of staying strong and healthy.</Script_Text>
